multprimes
==========

Multprimes is a program for generating multiplication tables of prime numbers.

Why?
----

To fulfil a coding challenge :-)

Installation
------------

Clone the repository, build the gem, then install it:

```
INSERT GEM COMMANDS HERE
```

Usage
-----

Running `multprimes` without arguments will perform the default action of
printing a multiplication table of the first ten primes formatted for screen
output. You can configure the number of primes to include in the table, and
you can also choose to output the table as a CSV; run `multprimes -h` for
details of these command line options.
